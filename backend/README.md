# Simple Docker Dashboard Backend

## I. Introduction

This is a simple FastAPI app, use JWT for token creation, SQLite (default) as database, SQLModel (aiosqlite) for interacting with database and aiohttp to interact with model.

## II. Conversation structure

You can image the conversation structure as a tree, where each node is a message from user or from model. It work like how ChatGPT conversations work, when you edit an message, a new conversation is create yet keep the old one.

```
System prompt
|
Assistant
|    \
User  U <- Users edit a message, create a new branch
|     |
A     A <- Model continue as a new conversation
|     | \
U     U  U <- Create a new branch when users edit their message
|     |
A     A
|
U
|
...
```


## III. Endpoints

### 1. AI


```
System prompt
|
Assistant <- GET /ai/children Get all direct children of this message
|    \     |
User  U <--+ Expect to return these messages ID
|     |
A     A
|     |
U     U <- GET /ai/conversation Get all message from the newest branch
|
A <- /ai/conversation?message Get all message from branch that contain the message in query
|
U <--+
|    |
... <- POST /ai/prompt Send message message base on previous message ID, allowing create new branch
```
